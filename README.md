# interitus ALPHA

Interitus is a minecraft mod.
It is not finished yet and important features are still missing or incomplete. 
A lot of things will change in future versions.
This experimental version is for testing only.

Features:

- Advanced Structure Block (already working)
  - A modified version of the vanilla structure block, with new features und better performance.
  - structures are saved in a new, more efficient data format (bit array instead of nbt tag for every single block)
  - max strcuture size 128x128 (8x8 chunks), vanilla limit is 32x32 (2x2 chunks)
  - strcuture data tool (item):
      - set custom loot tables for containers (chests, ...) in structures
      - set conditions for structures (for generation)
      
- Structure Packs (WIP)
  - Save your structures in a structure pack (similiar to texture packs or data packs, but for structures)
  - export a set of structures to a single file, and load it in other worlds (or share it with friends or online)
  - your structures are generated in this world (depending on the config options of the pack) (WIP)
  
- and more (WIP)
